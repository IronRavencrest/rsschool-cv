###About myself
I'm 24 years old, currently a third-year student of St. Petersburg University of Management Technologies and Economics (UMTE). Since highschool I've been fond of programming, so I'm always looking for new ways to gain knowledge in this area, that's why I'm here today. I see front-end development as a new way to gain skills and an opportunity to find a suitable job.

Know the basics of:
* C++, C, Java
* Blender, Adobe Photoshop

###Code Example:
#####Write a boolean expression using conditional operators, relational operators, and logical operators in an algorithmic language

```
int main()
{
    setlocale(LC_ALL,"eng");
    double x=0, y=0;
    bool f;
    printf("Type X\n");
    scanf ("%lf", &x);
    printf("Type Y\n");
    scanf ("%lf", &y);
    f=(((y<=2)&(x>=-2)&(x<=y-2))|((y<=2)&(x<=2)&(y>=-x+2)));
    switch(f)
    {
    case 1:
        printf("Point in shaded area  ");
        break;
    case 0:
        printf("Point not in shaded area ");
        break;
    }
    return 0;
}
